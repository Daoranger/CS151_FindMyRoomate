# CS151-FindMyRoommate
## Group 7: Yohannes Habtemariam, Hoang Nguyen, Da Thao Trinh

FindMyRoommate is a website designed to help individuals find compatible roommates for shared living situations. The website allows users to create a profile, search for potential roommates based on various criteria such as location, budget, lifestyle preferences, and interests, and communicate with potential matches.

### Problem

Imagine you get accepted to San Jose State University and you are not a local student. You need to find a place to live so that you can commute easily to school; but you don’t have any friends or relatives in San Jose to ask. The cost of the apartments around school is also expensive too. You want to reduce the cost by looking for some schoolmates who can split the rent with you.

### Previous Works

Nowadays, there are a lot of websites/apps that assist us to look for rooms or roommates such as Cragslist, LiveWith and Roomi...  However, while Cragslist is known for a lot of scamms, Roomi asks the users to pay a subscription plan if 
they want to have access to some exclusive benefits. LiveWith is a free app, but it's only available for Apple users.

### Intended Usage and Environment

FindMyRoommate will be built exclusively for SJSU students to avoid scams. As a requirement, only students with active school emails are able to register and public their profiles. The website also provides full access to all students and is free of charge too.

### User Operations

* The users are all SJSU students who looking for roommates to share a place with. 
* In order to secure the information of the students, it’s required to use the school email to sign up.
* Upon signing up, the users are required to answer some basic information such as first/last name, gender, contact information, short description about themselves, monthly budget, household size, preferred roommate gender, preferred location, living preferences (potato couch/party animal, bedtime, cleanliness…), habits (smoking, vaping, drinking…).
* After signing up, the website will direct the users to the main page, which contains the profile of other people who looking for roommates as well.
* Users can start a chat with their potential roommates through the website.
* If the users already have a place and want to share/sublease their place, they can also post pictures of their place and share some information about the place such as short description, location, amenities, cost...
